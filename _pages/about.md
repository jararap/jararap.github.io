I am Jia Peng, a penultimate PhD candidate at Singapore Management University (SMU), supervised by [Prof. Hady W. Lauw](hadylauw.com). My primary research interest is on Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics. The word that ties all my research together is *perspective*, exploring how we investigate problems through a different lens in pursuit of interpretability and explainability.

There are many good reasons to pursue a PhD, but the reason that resonates with me the most is *why not?* Unlike most of my peers, I started my PhD with zero research experience and perhaps even entering it a bit too naively. Fortunately, for most of the PhD, I was pretty self-driven, which helped me to mature as a researcher and problem-solver. Throughout my many projects, some of which made it out as publications, I grew my competency in popular machine learning frameworks/libraries, Python, Java, and C++. And, I have since realized that it is the engineering aspects of the research problems that light up that fire in me.

I am currently on the lookout for research/engineering opportunities in the industry. If my profile is of interest, please reach out to me via [email](mailto:jiapeng.lim.2021@phdcs.smu.edu.sg)!

Finally, I gratefully acknowledge the support for my research:
* AISG Research PhD Fellowship Award
* Singapore Data Science Consortium Dissertation Research Fellowship.
